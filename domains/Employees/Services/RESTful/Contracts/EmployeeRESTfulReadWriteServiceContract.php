 * Interface ***`EmployeeRESTfulReadWriteServiceContract`***
 *
 * The `EmployeeRESTfulReadWriteServiceContract` interface defines the contract for a RESTful read-write service specific to the Employees module.
 * This interface extends the RestJsonReadWriteServiceContract interface provided by the Core module.
 * It inherits the methods for both reading and writing resources in a RESTful manner.
 *
 * Implementing classes should provide the necessary functionality to perform `read` and `write` operations on Employee resources via RESTful API endpoints.
